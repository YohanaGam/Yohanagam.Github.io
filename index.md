### Data Projects


#### [People Analytics Project (Power BI)]([https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sql-exploratory-data-analyses-healthcare-yohana-gambarini/](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/people-analytics-yohana-gambarini%3FtrackingId=nm1uIoN7RU6TMCG2YYw8yQ%253D%253D/?trackingId=nm1uIoN7RU6TMCG2YYw8yQ%3D%3D))

For this project, I am using Power BI to explore 1 dataset that represents data from 2006 to 2018. The datasets can be found here.
The CSV file revolves around a fictitious company and the core data set contains names, DOBs, age, gender, marital status, date of hire, reasons for termination, department, whether they are active or terminated, position title, pay rate, manager name, performance score, Absences, and Performance Review.

#### [The HealthCare Project (SQL)](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/sql-exploratory-data-analyses-healthcare-yohana-gambarini/)

In this case study I am using MySQL to explore 2 data datasets that represent data from over 130 hospitals. Among other insights, you will see that I was able to query information like:

1. Distribution of time spent in the hospital.
   
2. What medical specialties are doing the most number of lab procedures on average?

4. What is the average service rate charge for loans given?
   
5. What was the most expensive project in Tunisia with the highest Original Principle Amount?
