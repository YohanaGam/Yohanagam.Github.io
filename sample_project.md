## DoorDash Marketing Analyses and the Case of a Suspicious Customer.

**Introduction:** I am doing this project to understand better what kind of #data we can pull out from a Marketing campaign in a Food delivery business.
I am playing a role as the #data Analyst that will summarize the information, so can be more easily understandable.
Overall, the company wants to improve it's marketing & wants to see who has purchased following a marketing campaign.

### 1. I learned that:

Investigating and building a dashboard is not enough, it’s necessary to know how to explain the data.
It’s important to understand from where the Data comes from.
Data is really interesting and I enjoy working with the several aspects of it.

```python
print('this is the python code I used to solve this problem')
```

### 2. The Data.
