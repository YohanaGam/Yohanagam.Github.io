## The Education Project.

**Introduction:** This project is part of the Data Analytics Accelerator program that I am taking to improve and practice my Data Skills. 

Therefore, I am acting as recently hired Data Analyst with the purpose to analyze the education data from the State of Massachusetts. The Department of Education Superintendent is looking for the following:

- A report to show the school board the state of the school system 

- How does class size affect college admission?

- What are the top math schools in the state?

- What schools are struggling the most?


###  The data set

The data set is REAL data taken from Massachusetts Department of Education Website from the year 2017. It is actually a combination of multiple reports with information about  Enrollment by Grade, Enrollment by Selected Population, Enrollment by Race/Gender and etc. 

The reports can be found here. [Link](https://profiles.doe.mass.edu/statereport/)


###  Analyses

Once the data was connected to Tableau. I started to analyze the information to see how and where to go to cross information. 

Totals are important to have a sense of the big picture and to further test the analyses comparing aggregations. 

So, in the first place the total number of schools and total number of students enrolled were calculated by simply counting the schools' names and summing the students:

- Number of Schools = 1,861
- Number of Students = 943,748
- Wich means an average of  507,118 students per school

1. What schools need extra attention? Thus, has lowest graduation rates?

   A bar chart with the bottom 10 high schools in terms of graduation% is the best option to illustrate the rank. So, the % Graduated metric was crossed with the schoolâ€™s names:
